## Brief Introduction

&#8195;&#8195;I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Information Science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2024–2027). Prior to this, I obtained a Master of Management degree from Henan Medical University (Library, Information, and Archives Management, 2021–2024) and a Bachelor of Management degree from Jinling College of Nanjing University (Information Management and Information Systems, 2017–2021).  

&#8195;&#8195;My research primarily focuses on scientometrics, with an emphasis on academic journals, open science, and science and technology evaluation. I also maintain a strong interest in peer review and research ethics, and am committed to promoting academic integrity. In addition, I am actively exploring digital humanities and smart library construction.  

&#8195;&#8195;To date, I have published over 20 academic papers. My research findings have appeared in international journals such as **Humanities and Social Sciences Communications**, **Journal of Medical Internet Research**, **Scientometrics**, **Journal of Information Science**, **Journal of Scholarly Publishing**, and **Sustainability**, as well as in domestic core journals including **Library and Information Service**, **Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals**, **Acta Editologica**, **Digital Library Forum**, and **Journal of Library and Information Science in Agriculture**.

&#8195;&#8195;Concurrently, I serve as an **editorial board member** for **COLLNET Journal of Scientometrics and Information Management**, **IP Indian Journal of Library Science and Information Technology**, **Jurnal Kajian Informasi & Perpustakaan**, a **editorial review board** for Health Informatics Journal, and a **scientific committee member** for **Revue des Sciences de l'Information**.  

&#8195;&#8195;I am also reviewers for more than fifty journals, including **Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals** (CSSCI), **Health Information and Libraries Journal** (SSCI), **Information Research** (SSCI), **JMIR mHealth and uHealth** (SCI), **JMIR Public Health and Surveillance** (SCI), **JMIR Serious Games** (SCI), **Journal of Medical Internet Research** (SCI), **Journal of the Medical Library Association** (SSCI), **Learned Publishing** (SSCI), **Malaysian Journal of Library and Information Science** (SSCI), **Scientometrics** (SSCI) and **Serials Review** (SSCI). I welcome additional editorial/review invitations in related fields.  

&#8195;&#8195;Moving forward, I will further dedicate myself to advancing information science and meta-science research from a multidisciplinary perspective, focusing on the evolution of science and technology evaluation policies, academic exchange systems, and knowledge dissemination models.
